My heart overflows
With sweet romantic feelings
When I think of you,
My eyes are missing you,
I wish that your family agrees to marry me
In a romantic ceremony,
But in vain! My heart is over-strained,
I am in love,
And I want nothing more than to be with you!
When I was young,
My whole world was consumed by your splendour,
I imagined you,
The wise ones,
The beautiful ones,
Who had attained the loftiest heights,
Who had enjoyed the finest soil,
Who had lived in the deepest parts of the earth!
I fancied you still live,
The bloated corpses of your people,
Who starved to death on the Egyptian highroad!
When I look into your eyes,
The deep sadness in your soul,
I wish that your descendants will never forget me!
When I look into your dreams,
