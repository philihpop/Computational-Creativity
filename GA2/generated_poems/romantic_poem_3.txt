Beloved and lost,
lost and never found,
lost and never found.
Babe,
your love is my whole,
my whole,
even if only for a moment.
Debate,
latch,
date,
love,
offer…
but never forget…
your love is my whole,
even if only for a moment.
Romantic poem,
biography,
lecture,
life-pregnant,
wounded,
smell,
smell…
ever in my soul.
As your love, my whole,
beyond your dreams…
and my dreams.
As your love, my whole,
beyond your ceaseless stares.
Love you, my whole,
’Kiss, kiss me…
’mourn I for you…
’never forget…
my love….
and yours.
Babe
